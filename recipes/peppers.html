    <h1>Vegetarian Stuffed Peppers</h1>
    <img src="../images/peppers.jpeg">
    <h2>Vegetarian Stuffed Peppers are filled to the brim with brown rice, spinach, mushrooms, and tofu—an ideal weeknight meal. </h2>
    <p>  At the heart of the dish is comfort: Warm, cheesy rice festooned with mushrooms and cubed tofu, seasoned with cumin and paprika, and tucked into a red pepper that cooks until tender enough to slice with ease.</p>

    <p>The peppers are warm, filling, and enormously healthful. It’s the type of dish I crave when I want something comforting, but don’t want to land in a food coma. Trust me, these stuffed peppers promise a very good dinner, whether you are a devout vegetarian or not. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
    <li>3/4 cup uncooked long-grain brown rice</li>
    <li>6 large red, orange, or yellow bell peppers</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 large yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 large cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 1/4 teaspoons smoked paprika</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>2 medium carrots, diced</li>
    <li>1 stalk celery, diced</li>
    <li>8 ounces button mushrooms, sliced then roughly chopped</li>
    <li>1 cup low sodium vegetable stock or water</li>
    <li>8 ounces firm tofu, drained and cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
    <li>2 packed cups baby spinach</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    <li>5 ounces Gruyere cheese, grated</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat oven to 400°F. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bring a medium pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add the rice and boil until tender, about 40 minutes. Drain well. Set rice aside until you are ready to finish the filling.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Cut the tops off the bell peppers and pull out the seeds and membranes. Set the peppers upright in a 9x13-inch baking pan. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high. Add the onion and sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, cumin, paprika, salt, pepper, carrots, celery, and mushrooms. Sauté for a minute and add the broth or water.</p>

            <p>Reduce the heat medium or medium low. You want the liquid to simmer, not boil. Cook until the vegetables are nearly tender, stirring regularly, about 10 minutes. Add a few tablespoons of water if the pan is dry. The filling should be moist, but not saucy. Remove from heat.</p>
            
            <p>Gently stir in 2 cups cooked rice, tofu, spinach, and lemon juice into the vegetables. Add the cheese and stir again to combine. Taste and add more salt, if needed. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Spoon the filling into the peppers, patting it down. It’s ok if the filling domes above the edge of the peppers a bit. You may have extra filling, which is tasty on its own. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Put the tops on the peppers and bake until they begin to wrinkle and are tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Serve warm. </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
