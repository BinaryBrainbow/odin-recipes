    <h1>Strawberry Shortcake Cake</h1>

    <h2>The ultimate summer dessert is here.</h2>
    <p>Strawberry shortcakes are a cookout classic, but sometimes you want to impress for a birthday or celebration. Would you believe me if I said that for roughly the same amount of effort as baking and assembling individual shortcakes, you could make a showstopping three-tiered version? Strawberry shortcake cake is sure to earn you some oohs and ahhs. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    

<h4>For the cake</h4>
<ul>
<li>2 2/3 cups (320g) all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups (300g) sugar</li>
<li>2 tablespoons baking powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1 cup (227g) unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
<li>1 1/4 cups buttermilk</li>
<li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
<li>3 large eggs, room temperature</li>
</ul>

<h4>For the strawberries</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound fresh strawberries</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
</ul>

<h4>For the whipped cream</h4>
<ul>
<li>4 ounces (113g) cream cheese, softened</li>
<li>1/2 cup (60g) powdered sugar</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
<li>A few whole strawberries, to decorate</li>
</ul>



    <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease and flour three 8-inch cake pans or two 9-inch round cake pans. If desired, line the bottom of the pans with parchment rounds. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Add the butter and mix on low speed until the mixture looks sandy, about 2 minutes.</p>

                <p>Pour in the buttermilk and vanilla extract. Mix on low speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Then increase the speed to medium and continue mixing for 30 seconds.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing on low speed until fully combined. Scrape the bottom and sides of the mixing bowl with a spatula after each addition. After adding the last egg, mix on medium-high speed for 30 seconds. The batter should be smooth and thick. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Divide the batter evenly among the pans and smooth the tops with an offset spatula or the back of a spoon. If you have a kitchen scale, each layer should weigh about 15 ounces (425g) for three 8-inch layers, or about 22 1/2 ounces (640g) per layer for two 9-inch layers. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> For 8-inch cakes, bake for 21 to 24 minutes. If you're baking two 9-inch layers, bake for 28 to 33 minutes. The edges should just be starting to pull from the sides of the pan and turning golden brown. A toothpick inserted into the center of one of the layers should come out clean.</p>

                <p>Cool the cakes in the pan for 5 minutes. Run an offset spatula or butter knife around the edge of the cakes to loosen them from the pan, then carefully turn them out onto a rack to cool completely. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>While the cakes cool, prepare the macerated strawberries. Use a paring knife to hull the strawberries. Then, placing them flat side down on the cutting board, slice them into 1/8 to 1/4-inch slices. </p>

                <p>Transfer the sliced strawberries to a bowl, pour in the sugar, and stir to coat them evenly. Cover the bowl and let the strawberries sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> In the cleaned bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract on medium speed until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. </p>

                <p>With the mixer still running, slowly pour in the heavy cream in a steady stream. Continue beating on medium speed until the mixture thickens and stiff peaks form. When you lift the whisk out of the cream, the whipped cream should come to a point at the tip of the whisk that stays upright.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Place one of the cake layers, right side up, on a large plate or cake stand. Use an offset spatula or the back of a spoon to spread about 1 cup (1 1/2 cups for a 9-inch two-layer cake) of the whipped cream evenly over the cake layer. Arrange half of the strawberries in an even layer on top of the whipped cream. Repeat with the second cake layer. </p>

                <p>If you're making a two-layer cake, top with another 1 1/2 cups of whipped cream and pile the remaining strawberries on top. For a three-layer cake, add the last layer and spread with about 1 cup of the whipped cream. Use an offset spatula or the back of a spoon to create swoops and swirls. Garnish the top of the cake with extra strawberries. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The cake is best enjoyed immediately after assembly.</p>

                <p>That said, it will keep, covered, for up to 3 days in the refrigerator. It won't look as pretty as the strawberry juice starts to run, but it's still delicious. The extra whipped cream will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. </p>
